# Airbnb Data Analysis Web Application

## Overview

This Python script creates a web application for analyzing Airbnb data using Streamlit. The application consists of three main sections: "Home," "Visualize Data," and "Contact."

### Home Section

- Provides an overview of Airbnb, its history, and impact on the travel industry.
- Includes a brief description, a YouTube video, key statistics, and a button to download the Airbnb application.
- Users can navigate to this section by selecting "Home" from the sidebar.

### Visualize Data Section

- Offers interactive visualizations based on Airbnb data using Plotly and Folium.
- Includes a dynamic price heatmap showing average prices across different locations and a Folium map with markers representing Airbnb listings.
- Allows users to filter data based on country, property type, and other parameters to analyze pricing trends, review scores, and availability.
- Provides options to download filtered data as a CSV file.
- Users can navigate to this section by selecting "Visualize data" from the sidebar.

### Contact Section

- Contains information about the developer and expresses gratitude to collaborators.
- Provides the developer's contact information and invites inquiries or assistance.
- Users can navigate to this section by selecting "Contact" from the sidebar.
